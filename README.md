# prednet-pytorch

Code and models accompanying [Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08104) by Bill Lotter, Gabriel Kreiman, and David Cox. 

The [original version](https://github.com/coxlab/prednet) is keras, and I want to use [pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) to make the result more clear.

I am sure that my prednet can get the same result of original version, but the pix2pix is not good enough.

This version is just for saving, if you are puzzled for some code, let me know through the issue.
